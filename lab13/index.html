    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>The challenge today was to use the for loop to create a function that loops through
        numbers 1 through 200 and labels multiples of 3 as "Fizz!", multiples of 5 as "Buzz!"
        and mulitples of 7 as "Boom!" as well as combines the Fizz, Buzz, and Boom labels if
        the number is a multiple of a combination of 3, 5, or 7.

    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>Creating the for loop itself was pretty simple for us. However, we did struggle for
      a while when it came to print in the output div. We struggled because we had the syntax
      right to get it to output but we didn't realize that not only did we need for the code
      to be within the function, but that it needed to be retyped within each if statement. Once
      we realized this our code worked like a charm and we were able to do a couple of the bonus
      tasks as well. </p>
