    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Our challenge this week was to use jQuery to create buttons that would
      toggle classes on and off.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>Our problems began this week after Katelyn missed a lecture and Lluvia's section did
      not explicitly go over the material covered in lecture. Despite this, we managed to
      complete up to Task Two of the Lab. We ran into problems on Task Three, because our
      Javascript (specifically our attempt to use toggleClass) would not change anything on our local files.
      We attempted to trouble shoot for syntax errors, going back to the
      lecture slides, looking up functions, and texting the Discord, but were unable to
      find a solution that changed anything. After a really long time we decided to stop trying and wait
      for further instruction in lecture on Thursday. We were unable to meet to work on the Lab early enough for office hours
      to be available. After lecture on Thursday, we gave the Lab another try, and were able to complete it succesfully.</p>
