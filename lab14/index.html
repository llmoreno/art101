  <div id="challenges" class="sectionbox">
    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p> This week's challenge was to go back over past labs and debug. At the time of this assignment, all of our labs
        were functional, and didn't require debugging, so instead we attempted one of the bonus tasks.
      </p>
  </div>

  <div id="problems" class="sectionbox">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p> Because we didn't have any labs to fix and resubmit, we decided to skip straight to the bonus task and try using
      the debugger feature. We were a little confused at how many times we should use this debugger feature within our
      code, especially since none of our Javascript files are very lengthy. This question was our only real issue. </p>
  </div>

  <div id="results" class="sectionbox">
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The results for Lab 8 can be found in the console, as well as the results of using Debugger. Unless console is open when the
      page is reloaded, Debugger will not do anything.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="debug" class="sectionbox">
    <h2>Debugging</h2>
      <p>Since we didn't have any broken labs, here are our experimentations with Debugger on Lab 8 and Lab 9:
