<div id="challenge">
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p> For this assignment we had to practice pseudocoding twice. The first time,
			we practiced making a step by step list for an everyday task (something
			unrelated to computers and coding). Then, for the second one, we had
			to come up with pseudocode for a computer task.
		</p>
	</div>

<div id="problems">
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p> We definitely struggled deciphering the instructions for this
			assignment. The instruction on canvas were on the vague side so it
			took some deliberating to decide how to interpret them. The only other
			problem we ran into was coming up with a computer task. Neither Katelyn
			nor Lluvia have experience in coding so it's hard to know where to
			begin with a task like this. We decided to try to come up with something
			that would be relevant to our jobs working for Student Media. Word
			clouds are pretty popular at SOMeCA events so we decided on pseudocoding
			a word cloud. We only ran into problems when we tried to style our page with CSS.
			Each of our local files was diplaying differently on our own computers, until we realized
			that there were some syntax errors, and it all worked out fine.

	<h2>Results</h2>
		<p>For our initial task, we decided to explain how to paint on a canvas, step-by-step.</p>
	<h3>How to Paint a Canvas</h3>
		 <ol>
			 <li> Prime the canvas. </li>
			 <li> Gather materials. You'll need a canvas, paintbrushes of various sizes,
				 a cup of water, paints, a palette, a pencil, and a papertowel or rag to dry brushes on. </li>
			<li> Sketch your idea onto the canvas using the pencil. Be sure to draw
				lightly. </li>
			<li> Once your sketch is complete, you can start painting. Paint the
				background layer first.</li>
			<li> After your background layer is dry you can start on your next layer.
				Keep adding layers until your painting looks how you want it to. </li>
			<li> Optional: Seal your painting with a fixative. </li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Pseudocode for a Word Cloud Generator</h3>
		<p> Here is the JS pseudocode copied into our html.</p>
		<pre>
			//Generator creates unique code for users to connect to.
			    //Code appears in form of link, or typeable form
			//Generator has two input forms, one that accepts the code to connect, one that accepts the word cloud submission.
			//Generator sorts inputted words.
			    //Words that are repeated are combined.
			    //Words with spaces between are treated as separate submissions.
			    //Words with commas are treated as one submission.
			//Generator creates image of submitted words.
			    //Generator assigns random orientation and color to each word, excluding upside down orientation.
			    //Words that were repeated appear larger in the word cloud than words that were typed only once.
			//Generator gives option to save output as image file.</pre>
