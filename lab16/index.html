    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>Today's challenge was to implement a specific API, that of the XKCD web comic. This time we were dealing with both images and other information.</p>

  <div id="problems" class="sectionbox">
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>At first the image wasn’t loading on the webpage and we weren’t sure why, but eventually we realized that we had two major errors.
        First, we found a syntax error in our HTML where our ID was, and second we accidentally called the wrong global variable. Once these two things were fixed, our Javascript worked perfectly.</p>
