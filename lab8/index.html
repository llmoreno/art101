      <h2>Challenge</h2>
    		<p>Today we had to use the function settimeout to test out anonymous functions and callbacks.<p>
    	<h2>Problems</h2>
    		<p>We did not have any problems following along with the instructions this week,
          nor did we get any console errors! This was our fastest completion time yet, so we decided to
          try some of the bonus tasks.</p>
    	<h2>Results</h2>
        <p>This week our results are in the console! Right click and "Inspect" to see what we did.</p>
