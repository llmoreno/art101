  <div id="content">
  	<h2>Challenge</h2>
  		<p> Today our challenge was to create a function that scrambles user's names using arrays. </p>
  	<h2>Problems</h2>
  		<p> We only had one small syntax error when tackling the Lab, however we were easily
      able to problem shoot and fix the issue. Our real problem was taking on the bonus tasks.
      We independently tried to figure out two of the bonus prompts, one being how to sort
      without acknowledging uppercase and the other being how to style the script output.
      Stackoverflow and other sites had solutions that seemed more advanced than what we could deal with.
      We didn't want to simply copy and paste without a larger understanding of how the code was working.</p>
  	<h2>Results</h2>
      <p> Below is our working function which sorts the user input.</p>
  	 <div class="output">
  		 <h3>Script Output</h3>
  	   <script  type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
  	 </div>
  </div>
