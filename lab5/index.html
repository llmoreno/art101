<div id="content">
	<h2>Challenge</h2>
		<p> Working as partners, Lluvia and Katelyn experimented with Javascript
		data types and variables to print out information about a car. </p>
	<h2>Problems</h2>
		<p>The main challenge that Lluvia and Katelyn faced when working
		on Lab 5 was linking the Javascript file to the HTML file so that it would print.
		Ultimately we realized that the file had linked correctly, but there was a syntax error in our document function.
		Lluvia figured this out by googling the error that came up in the console when the local
		file was inspected.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
