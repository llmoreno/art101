    <h2>Challenge</h2>
      <p>This week we're experimenting with events and input forms.
        Our goal is to sort user input and return it.</p>
    <h2>Problems</h2>
      <p>Our main problem was syntax errors because Lluvia forgot to update the id names
      in the JS file after changing them in the HTML. After updating the existing stuff that we
      had done in class with Wes, we tested our page and realized that our scipt output
      would appear shoved up against our button. We didn't like the way this looked so we
      went into the Javascript file and added padding. This made our script output
      appear a lot nicer.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>Input your name:</p>
      <input type="text" id = "user-name"><br>
      <button id="my-button">Submit</button><br>
      <p>Your new name will appear here:</p>
    <div id="output">
       <h3> </h3>
     </div>
  </div>
  </body>
</html>
