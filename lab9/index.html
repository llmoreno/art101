      <h2>Challenge</h2>
        <p>This week we are practicing with identifying and manipulating different Web
          elements with JavaScript. We assigned a div to a variable, created new elements, and then
          appended and styled those new elements.<p>
      <h2>Problems</h2>
        <p>Working in JS was fairly straightforward for us. The trickiest part was trying
          to remember the way to style elements, because we both only remembered how to use
          style.color and hadn't taken notes on the other styling conventions that Wes had shown us.
          We even felt confident enough to attempt to find a solution for bonus task 1. After finding
          a solution that sounded feasible on w3schools, we attempted to use it the same way as appendChild,
          but failed to realize that the solution, insertBefore, took two arguments. After fixing that issue,
          we were able to add the element to the top of our Results section.</p>
