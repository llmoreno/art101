		<h1> Lab 3 - File Structures</h1>
			<p> This Lab focused on creating an organized file structure to ensure that
				things could get linked with ease, and that my local files were in order.</p>
		<h2> Challenges</h2>
			<p> I had already worked ahead, so to speak, so it was actually a bit challenging
				to go back step by step and make sure my files were good to go. In a way, this helped
				me further understand how the HTML works together.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>Here is my final file structure.</p>

			<p>I used Wes' suggestion on captions to make my screenshots a little bit more organized.
				Here is my homepage, with all of the Labs listed, but without any extra formatting
				for the image.</p>
